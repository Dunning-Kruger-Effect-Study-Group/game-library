# Game Library

This is a mono repository containing both parts of a complete full stack aplication, using the following technologies:

- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/) 
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Pre-requisites

Install:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Node 20.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [NX](#running-the-applications)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Study:

- [JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)

## Apps

For managing the monorepository it uses [NX](https://nx.dev), it contains three apps in it:

- [game-library](/apps/game-library/README.md)
- [backend](/apps/backend/README.md)
- [mongodb](/apps/mongodb/README.md)

## Running the applications 

All apps have a project.json file generated by NX, which contain all the configured runners for the commands that the application can run, to see the commands check the **project.json** file inside each app.

Since we use NX, you will need it to run the application, so you can either install it globally and use it directly or run the commands with npx before them.

### Global install for NX

Firstly install the NX package globally using NPM:

`npm i -g nx`

Then run the apps using:

`nx <command name> <appname>`

### Without global NX

`npx nx <command name> <app name>`

## Testing

It is recommended that you install the [Jest extension for VSCode](vscode:extension/Orta.vscode-jest) and that while testing to turn on Jest coverage overlay to see what code needs tests to be written for it, to do so:

Use this shortcut:

`ctrl + shift + p`

Then type and use:

`Jest: Toggle Coverage`
