# Game Library

This GitHub project is a game library and categorization software developed collaboratively by the [Dunning-Kruegger Effect study group](https://discord.gg/nWN8N9yh7x). Here's how it is structured and some features it has:

# Repository Structure:

## Monorepository 

As the name sugests, a [mono repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) (or monorepo) is a code repository which contains multiple projects inside of it, this helps reduce code duplication and allows for eaiser maintenance.

We use [NX](https://nx.dev/) to manage this, it has tools for building, testing, linting, creating new apps and it configures everything for us without us lifting a finger, it handle the build process for typescript and webpack, it has a smart CI technology that detects the effect of the changes that each branch has and run the appropriate tests for those changes.

Inside NX we have 3 applications:
it contains three apps in it:

- [game-library](/apps/game-library/README.md)
- [backend](/apps/backend/README.md)
- [mongodb](/apps/mongodb/README.md)

### Frontend (React):

Contains the user interface for browsing games, categorizing them, and managing the library.
Utilizes React components for a responsive and interactive UI.
Uses state management tools like Redux for managing application state.

### Backend (Node.js and Express):

Provides RESTful APIs for handling requests from the frontend.
Manages authentication, game data storage, and retrieval.
Utilizes Express middleware for routing and validation.

### Database (MongoDB):

Stores game information, user data, and categorization details. The NX app contains instructions to launch and configure the database using Docker.

Utilizes MongoDB's flexibility for storing game metadata like title, genre, release date, description, images, etc.

Provides fast querying capabilities for retrieving specific game information.

## Collaboration Workflow:
Branching Strategy: Utilizes Git branches for different features or fixes, following a branching model like Gitflow for better collaboration.

Pull Requests and Code Reviews: Team members create pull requests for proposed changes, allowing others to review code before merging.

Issue Tracking: We use GitHub issues to track bugs, feature requests, and enhancements.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Implements CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes.

## Tech Stack

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/) 
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)

## Pre-requisites

Install:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Node 20.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Running the applications 

All apps have a project.json file generated by NX, which contain all the configured runners for the commands that the application can run, to see the commands check the **project.json** file inside each app.

Since we use NX, you will need it to run the application, so you can either install it globally and use it directly or run the commands with npx before them.

### Global install for NX

Firstly install the NX package globally using NPM:

`npm i -g nx`

Then run the apps using:

`nx <command name> <appname>`

### Without global NX

`npx nx <command name> <app name>`

## Testing

It is recommended that you install the [Jest extension for VSCode](vscode:extension/Orta.vscode-jest) and that while testing to turn on Jest coverage overlay to see what code needs tests to be written for it, to do so:

Use this shortcut:

`ctrl + shift + p`

Then type and use:

`Jest: Toggle Coverage`
